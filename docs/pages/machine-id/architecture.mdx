This section provides an overview of Teleport Machine ID's inner workings.

A more in-depth specification of the workings of Machine ID can be found in
[the Request For Discussion.](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0064-bot-for-cert-renewals.md)

## Bot creation

In order to use the Machine ID agent (`tbot`), a bot must first be created using
`tctl bots add`.

A "bot" within Teleport is comprised of three resources, which are created by
the Auth Service when `tctl bots add` is executed:

- Bot user: this will be the user that the Machine ID agent authenticates as.
- Bot role: the bot user is assigned the bot role, and the bot role contains
  various permissions that the bot will need to function. For example, the
  ability to watch the certificate authorities and the ability to 
  [impersonate roles](#role-impersonation).
- Token: for [onboarding](#onboarding), a token must exist that allows the
  Machine ID agent to initially authenticate as the bot user. If an existing
  token is not specified, then a single-use token will be created by the Auth 
  Server.

## Role Impersonation

At the core of Machine ID is the concept of role impersonation.

Role Impersonation allows a user to generate credentials with a set of requested
roles. The user does not have to hold these roles, but must have been granted 
permission to impersonate them. The impersonated credentials still include
the username of the user that generated them, so actions can be attributed to 
the user.

These credentials can then be used to complete any action that is allowed by the
role's configured permissions. 

In the case of Machine ID, the bot user is assigned a bot role, which includes 
permissions to impersonate the roles that the user has configured.

## `tbot`

`tbot` is the binary that acts as the agent for Machine ID on your machines that
need access to resources protected by Teleport. It is typically ran in one of
two modes. By default, it is a daemon-like long-running process. This is
suitable for situations where your machine is long running and will need
continuous access to resources. `tbot` can also run in "oneshot" mode where it
will fetch credentials for your machine once before exiting. This is ideal for
short-lived environments such as CI/CD workflows.

Before `tbot` can be started, at least two parts of configuration will need to
be provided via the configuration file or as arguments provided to `tbot` when
it is executed. This consists of:

- [A join method](#onboarding) that the bot can use to prove that it should be
  allowed to join the Teleport cluster.
- A series of "destinations". A destination is a set of configuration that
  specifies where a set of credentials should be output, and any options that
  should be applied to those credentials (for example, what roles should be
  impersonated).

For more detail about the configuration options, see 
[the reference.](./reference.mdx)

On initial load, `tbot` uses the configured join method to obtain a set of 
credentials for the bot user from the Teleport Auth Service. It can then use 
these credentials to communicate with the Teleport Auth Service as the bot.

Then on a configured regular period `tbot` begins its renewal process. It begins
by refreshing the bot's own credentials, by renewing them or fetching a fresh 
set of credentials depending on the configured onboarding method.

For each destination provided in `tbot`'s configuration, `tbot` then uses
impersonation to obtain credentials from the Auth Service for the roles
specified in the destination's configuration. Once these are fetched, these are
then persisted to the destination in various formats along with other useful
matter such as the current certificate authority certificates.

Concurrently to this, `tbot` monitors the Teleport certificate authorities to
detect certificate rotations. When this occurs, it triggers additional renewals
to ensure that destination's continue to have certificates that are signed by
the latest certificate authority.

## Onboarding

Onboarding is the process by which `tbot` initially authenticates with the 
Teleport Auth Service in order to receive credentials.

Machine ID leverages the existing token resource within Teleport, with the
token containing an additional `botName` field that identifies the bot user
associated with the token. 

Machine ID currently supports two methods of joining that have some key
differences.

### Ephemeral token

- The name of the token is used as an opaque secret needed to join the Teleport 
  cluster. This means it must be stored and communicated securely.
- Once used, the token resource self-destructs. This means it can only be used 
  to join a single bot to a Teleport cluster.
- The certificates exchanged for the token are 
  renewable, as we will explain in the next section.


### Dynamic join tokens (e.g AWS IAM)

- These tokens rely on an external authority that allows the bot to prove it is 
  allowed to join the cluster. The name of the token identifies the Token
  resource in Teleport that contains the configuration.
- The token can be used to join as many bots as you want, and do not self
  destruct in the same way that ephemeral tokens do.
- The certificates exchanged for the token are not renewable. When the bot wants
  to renew its certificates, it simply repeats the original join steps.

Where possible, you should prefer to use a dynamic join token over an ephemeral
token as this eliminates the need to handle a secret.

## Renewable certificates

Human Teleport users are not able to renew their credentials without
re-authenticating. As Machine ID must work without manual human intervention,
bots that have joined using ephemeral tokens are granted credentials that are
marked as renewable. This means that the bot can use these credentials to
fetch a new set of credentials with an expiry date further in the future.

In order to mitigate the risk of bot user credentials being stolen, and then
continually renewed by a malicious actor, renewable bot user certificates
include a **generation counter**.

The generation counter is stored against the user in the database and within the
certificate. This counter is incremented each time the user renews their 
certificate. When a bot attempts to renew, the Auth Server ensures that the 
value within the certificate and in the database match. If they do not match,
then the bot user is automatically locked. This means that if certificates are
stolen, and attempted to be renewed whilst the bot is still running, the next
renewal will render them useless.

## File permissions

There are two types of folder in use by `tbot`:

- The bot's own files: these store credentials belonging to the `tbot` process
  itself. As these credentials are potentially renewable, and will allow the
  impersonation of any roles you have assigned to the bot user, they should be
  treated as exceptionally sensitive. The bot's own files are stored by default at 
  `/var/lib/teleport/bot/`.
- Directory destinations: when a directory destination is configured, the bot 
  outputs the role impersonated credentials as files in the specified directory.

It is important that we ensure that these files can only be accessed by the
fewest number of Linux processes and users on the system as is necessary.

In the case of the bot's own files, it is best practice to create a Linux user
specifically for running `tbot` and to ensure that only this user has access
to this directory.

In the case of directory destinations, the process the bot runs as requires read
and write permissions, and processes that will need the credentials output by 
the bot require read permissions. We recommend that you create a Linux user 
specific to the process that needs to access these files. When using 
`tbot init`, specify this Linux user as the "reader" to grant it access to the
destination.

In addition to basic POSIX filesystem permissions, `tbot init` also sets up
Linux ACLs if the system supports it. This allows more granular control by
granting individual users access.

Finally, on systems that support it, `tbot` will by default attempt to prevent 
the resolution of symbolic links when reading and writing files. This prevents a 
class of attacks sometimes known as 
[symlink attacks](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/132.html). This 
behaviour can be disabled using the `insecure` symlink option when configuring 
your destination.
